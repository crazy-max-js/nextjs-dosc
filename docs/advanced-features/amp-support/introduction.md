# AMP Support

:::details 示例
- [AMP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/amp)
:::

With Next.js you can turn any React page into an AMP page, with minimal config, and without leaving React.

You can read more about AMP in the official[amp.dev](https://amp.dev/)site.

## Enabling AMP

To enable AMP support for a page, and to learn more about the different AMP configs, read the[API documentation for`next/amp`](/docs/api-reference/next/amp).

## Caveats

- Only CSS-in-JS is supported.[CSS Modules](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support)aren't supported by AMP pages at the moment. You can[contribute CSS Modules support to Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/10549).
